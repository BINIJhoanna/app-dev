There are many aspects of this movie that I like that's how it became my favorite movie.

> This series depicts the real situations of average people:
>
> - It did not sugarcoat the working industry
>
> - It also shows the reality of being in a relationship with someone
>
> - It shows the ups and downs of a person who is reaching his/her dream
>
> It deviates from the usual Kdrama series where they only show the love story of the leads
>
> The actors did really great in portraying their character
